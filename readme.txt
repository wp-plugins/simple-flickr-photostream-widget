Simple Flickr Photostream widget allow you display pictures from Flickr in a widgetized area of you choice. Based on the WP 2.7 widget model

== Description ==

Simple Flickr Photostream widget is another Flickr photo display. I exists because no other plugins were doing what the author considered essential.

The plugin is essentialy a widget that will show picture from a chosen Flickr source, be it your own photostream, someone else's, one of your sets, a group, your favorite, etc...

The code is based on [FlickrRss](http://eightface.com/wordpress/flickrrss/) plugin made by Dave Kellam and Stefano Verna and improve by placing the control in the widget itself rather than an admin page. This new approach, combined with the way WP 2.7 handles widgets makes it multiwidget enabled with different options for each widgets.
